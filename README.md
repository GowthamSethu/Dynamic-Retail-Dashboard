# **Dynamic Retail Dashboard**  

## **Overview**  
This project involves the creation of a dynamic retail dashboard using **Microsoft Excel**, designed to visualize and analyze retail sales data across various dimensions. The dashboard connects to three main data tables‚Äî**Orders, Returns, and People**‚Äîand helps businesses gain insights into key sales performance metrics.  

The dashboard includes **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** that track important metrics such as:  
- **Total Sales**  
- **Total Profit**  
- **Quantity Sold**  
- **Number of Orders**  
- **Profit Margin**  

These KPIs are calculated and displayed on a centralized chart for easy comparison and visualization. The project covers multiple problem statements that help break down the data into actionable insights.
